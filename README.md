# Citizenlab Front-End Developer Assignment

## Introduction
The goal of this assignment is to develop a small single page application, displaying participation projects for the city of _Labbersville_. The assignment is a little vague on purpose and allows a good amount of freedom, so make use of it to show off!

## Assignment
The assignment is to make a listing page of participation projects for the imaginary city Labbersville, meant for the citizens. This page is also the landing page for their participation platform. A participation project is a project launched by the city officials to crowdsource ideas around a certain topic.

* The logo and welcome text of the city should be visible.

* Every project should at the very least show a title, the number of ideas and the number of engaged users to the project. Be smart and creative by showing more (or less?), the data provides you with plenty of opportunity.

* A search box on top allows you to filter the project by searching in their title and description. This should be functional.

* Next to that, as a secondary functionality, the most popular tags and the list of the 5 most trending ideas over all projects should be displayed on the same page in some way, allowing the user to directly access them. (behaviour after clicking them is not part of the assignment). 

* The goal for the citizen is to enter one of the projects, where she will be able to see all the ideas related to this project. This idea listing page is not part of the assignment, but reaching a dummy page by clicking should work.

* Next to that, actions for logging in/out, editing a profile and choosing a language(nl/fr/en) should be visible. None of it should be functional.

* The page should be usable on mobile and on desktop/tablet. 

In this repository you can find all the files and assets: Texts, graphics and mock API responses with all the available data. 
Donâ€™t waste time making a backend API to serve the json responses, simply fake a working API in the front-end!

## Rules

* You can (and should!) use any third party library or framework you want, but you have to provide us with a list of used code/frameworks. This also includes code from snippets/SO answers/gists/tutorials...

* All code not included in the list, you have written yourself.

* We are fans of angular2 and you score points by using it. However, if you have experience in similar frameworks, the quality of your solution is way more important.

* The end result is delivered in a privately shared git repository user `kogre` on github or user `koeng` on bitbucket. It contains a `README.md` that explains how to run it.

* By handing in the assignment, in case your assignment leads to you being hired by Citizenlab NV, the code you wrote for the assignment becomes the intellectual property of Citizenlab NV.

## Evaluation

The evaluation is based on 2 axis:

### Design (60%)
How does the result look and feel? Is it attractive? Easy to use and understand? Fun to use? Is it clear? Original? What message does it convey? Bonus points for creating your own graphical assets. Be creative!

### Engineering (40%)
Are you respecting all aspects of a good engineered project, including abstractions, modularity, all aspects related to maintainability, testability and coding style. Are you making good use of the capabilities of the libraries/frameworks you chose?

### Process
If we like your work, we will go through your result together, giving you the chance to explain your choices.  What tradeoffs did you chose and what was the motivation?
